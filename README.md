##### Based on the iconic science-fiction show "Doctor Who," I created these 3D models of my favorite Sonic Screwdrivers and the "T.A.R.D.I.S." as depicted. These were the outcomes of my transition from using Solidworks to Onshape. I utilized this project to teach myself how to use a brand new C.A.D. Software, and to design things that I love.
